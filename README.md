# Bundesliga-Shot-Data-Comparison-Jamal-Musiala-vs.-Florian-Wirtz-2023-2024-

Overview
This project analyzes and compares the shot data of two prominent Bundesliga players, Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, for the 2023-2024 season. The primary objective is to visualize their shot locations using heatmaps, providing insights into their shooting patterns, preferences, and overall performance.

Motivation
With the increasing competitiveness of the Bundesliga, understanding player performance is crucial for fans, analysts, and teams. By comparing Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz, we can gain insights into their playing styles, strengths, and areas for improvement.

Data Collection
The shot data for both players was collected from Understat, a reliable source for football statistics. The data includes details such as:

Shot location (X, Y coordinates)
Shot type (e.g., headers, volleys, etc.)
Outcome (goal, save, miss)
Match information
Analysis
The analysis involved:

Data Cleaning: Ensuring the dataset is free from duplicates and irrelevant entries.
Data Processing: Converting coordinates and shot outcomes into a usable format for visualization.
Statistical Comparison: Calculating key metrics, such as shot accuracy and average shot distance, for both players.

Visualization
Heatmaps were created using Matplotlib to visualize the shooting patterns of Musiala and Wirtz. The heatmaps highlight areas on the pitch where each player is most effective, allowing for an intuitive comparison of their shot tendencies.

Results
The results from this analysis indicate:

Jamal Musiala shows a tendency to shoot from the left side of the pitch, particularly within the penalty area.
Florian Wirtz demonstrates a more varied shooting pattern, with significant attempts from outside the box.
These insights can help coaches and analysts in assessing player performance and making tactical decisions.
